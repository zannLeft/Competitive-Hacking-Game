# Competitive Hacking Game

A passion project developed in my free time. This online competitive hacking game is set in an immersive first-person environment where players can test their hacking skills while surviving and attempting to escape from a highly secure facility. 

## Features

- **Immersive First-Person Gameplay**: Experience the thrill of hacking from a first-person perspective, making every moment more intense.
- **Smooth, Customizable Controls**: The control system is built from the ground up to allow for complete customizability, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay.
- **Lobby System**: Play with friends or other competitors using a robust lobby system built with Unity's Netcode for GameObjects.
- **Work in Progress**: This project is a heavy work in progress, and new features and improvements are continuously being added.

## Devlog Entry #2 Long time no see!

It’s been a while since the last update. I’ve made my first Blender model for the final player design, added custom animations, implemented an immersive first-person POV, reworked the lobby system, and much more!
